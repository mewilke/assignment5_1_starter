# Assignment 5_1
# Observations:
# 1) There were a lot of empty fields in the car feature. I deleted this column because it did not contain enough useful data.
# 2) The passanger column title is misspelled. I did not correct it but would do so in the real world.
# 3) The columns direction_opp and direction_same have a correlation coefficient of -1. I deleted one of the columns.
# 4) Value_counts() of the remaining columns showed there is a good distribution among the various values. I kept these columns.
# 5) 76% of drivers used a coupon of some kind.
# 6) Take out food was the most popular type of coupon. Bar coupons were the least popular.
# 7) Between 30 and 80 degrees coupon use correlated positively with temperature.  
# 8) Only 57% of the drivers accepted bar coupons.
# 9) Only 14% of drivers who went to bars 3 or fewer times per month used coupons relative to those who went more than 3 times per month. 
# 10) 37% of drivers 25 or younger used a coupon to go to a bar relative to drivers over 25. 
# 11) People of various occupations (excluding farming, fishing, and forestry) are most likely to accept a coupon if they are unemployed.
# 12) Drivers who accepted the bar coupons tended to go to the bar more than once a month, with friends, and were in their 20s.
